# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple browser-based Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Click buttons to play.
- First to 5 wins the game.
- DOM updates show results and score.

The project started with a simple prompt and no UI. I created a feature branch, added button functionality, and replaced console logging with DOM manipulation. Finally, I styled everything to my liking.

Made with ❤️ as part of The Odin Project.
